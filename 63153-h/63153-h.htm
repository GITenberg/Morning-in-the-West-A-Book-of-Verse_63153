<p class="poem">
  Cun-ne-wa-bum&mdash;"one who looks on stars"&mdash;<br />
  (Feel the singing wind from out the western hills)<br />
  "The tip-end of a swan's wing is her fan,<br />
  With a handle of porcupine quills."<br />
  Here is the artist's name, Paul Kane;<br />
  Painting in forty-seven, at Edmonton, I see.<br />
  That was when prairies were untamed,<br />
  And untamed this young Cree.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  What an incantation in her name!<br />
  Magic as her dark face underneath the stars;<br />
  There is sword-like wind about it wrapped,<br />
  And echoes of old wars.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Cun-ne-wa-bum!<br />
  When turtle shells were rattling,<br />
  And the drums beat for the dance<br />
  In the great hall of the Factor's house till dawn,<br />
  You sat without the door,<br />
  Where the firelight on the floor<br />
  Caught the red of beads upon your moccasins.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  At evening through the grassy plains the wind<br />
  Came shouting down the world to meet the dawn,<br />
  And with the wind the firelight rose and fell,<br />
  Answered with flame his shrill barbaric yell,<br />
  And died like whining fiddles at his feet.<br />
  And through it all the constant sound of drums&mdash;<br />
  Did your feet move to drums?<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  The men from near and far,<br />
  Crees and Sarcees,<br />
  And a Blackfoot brave or two,<br />
  Made rhythm of a dance that moves like rhyme<br />
  To the rush of wind, and rattles swung in time<br />
  To the constant, constant, constant beat of drums.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  No Indian woman dances in the light;<br />
  Silent they sit together out of sight.<br />
  But to-night I think this artist from the East,<br />
  Who had come to paint the natives hereabout,<br />
  Found a splendid flare of crimson on the feast<br />
  And moved near the open door,<br />
  Where the firelight on the floor<br />
  Caught the red of beads upon your moccasins.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  So it is, O Cun-ne-wa-bum,<br />
  Who were wont to look on stars,<br />
  That you sit for ever here,<br />
  Like a wild lost note from far,<br />
  From the days of ancient war<br />
  And of towered stockade and guns<br />
  In the Edmonton of seventy years ago.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  In your buckskin and your beads<br />
  (Feel the sudden wind from out the western hills)<br />
  The tip-end of a swan's wing for your fan<br />
  With a handle of porcupine quills.<br />
</p>

  BALLAD OF JASPER ROAD<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  I know a Blackfoot Chief<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose name is Dark Plume Bill.<br />
  He lived beside the Jasper Road&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And lives there still.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  He wears a queer checked coat<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And a grey bowler hat,<br />
  But looks his ninety-seven years<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For all of that.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  His gaze is unconcerned<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As he sits in the sun,<br />
  And counts the flashing motor-cars<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That pass, one-by-one,<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And trucks, like dreary monsters<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a prehistoric day,<br />
  That are rushing down the road<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In their crazy way.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The first Red River cart,"<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said Dark Plume Bill to me,<br />
  "Came lurching up the prairie<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a ship at sea."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  (Oh, the long blue road,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stealthy pad of feet<br />
  And the first patient ox-cart<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With its sail-like sheet!)<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Then the carts came faster,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And at the time of snow<br />
  We camped outside the Palisade,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seventy years ago.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Arrows, guns&mdash;big Buffalo hunts,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Much long fight,<br />
  And fires to warm the tepees<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the feasts at night.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "But when they laid the steel<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the long trail awoke<br />
  My Indian tribe had scattered<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the wigwam smoke."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  His gaze was unconcerned,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet he scanned the way he knew,<br />
  As though from out its clamour<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had found a vanished clew.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  And I thought it must be strange<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To sit in the sun<br />
  And look upon an ancient road<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That you had seen begun<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Out of silence and mystery<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And crafty, ambushed death,<br />
  Come alive with men, and monsters<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of such an alien breath.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  (Oh, the long blue road<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the stealthy pad of feet<br />
  And the first patient ox-cart<br />

  BUFFALO MEAT
</h3>

<p class="t3">
  <i>A Daughter-in-law Writes</i><br />
</p>

<p><br/></p>

<p class="poem">
  It takes a letter sixty days to go&mdash;<br />
  An Indian boy runs down the trail to-night.<br />
  What shall I write to you?<br />
  My mind is full of gossip of a town<br />
  That you have never dreamed of.<br />
  So&mdash;shall I tell you of our shacks,<br />
  Huddled behind the tall stockade?<br />
  Our guns, with muzzles set against the prairie?<br />
  What if I write the truth!<br />
  Your son is now a savage;<br />
  By that much more I love him!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If I should say<br />
  I can stand all this tropic, summer heat<br />
  And menial tasks and crowded alleyways,<br />
  And fat squaws lounging in the sun,<br />
  And even water out of tainted wells,<br />
  And long, rough prairie rides&mdash;<br />
  All for the sake of autumn,<br />
  And its short, magic days of pure content!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  If you could know my mind!<br />
  A little British mind two years ago;<br />
  To-day a sort of crowded, pagan scroll,<br />
  Recording strange old customs<br />
  And legends, various as the Indian tribes,<br />
  And prayers and songs and dances.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Songs that are old as earth itself,<br />
  Dances as elemental:<br />
  Skin drums and tom-toms,<br />
  Rattles of turtle shell, and whirl of winds<br />
  Against the amphitheatre of hills.<br />
  You will remember they were playing Sheridan<br />
  When we left London!<br />
  I can count every lilac spray on the old drawing room chintz.<br />
  I hope&mdash;I hope you have not changed it since!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Let me begin again.<br />
  If I should say<br />
  I love this small, rough shack,<br />
  For it has made me brave&mdash;<br />
  Braver, at least, than when I saw it first,<br />
  And saw a sea of prairie<br />
  And the dim forms of buffalo herds<br />
  Darkening the far horizon!<br />
  I am braver now than when the halfbreeds came<br />
  Racing towards us on that first wild day,<br />
  Mad messengers to frighten us to death&mdash;<br />
  Servants of trappers and the Nor'-west men&mdash;<br />
  Those halfbreeds! feathers dangling, tomahawks!<br />
  That was in summer.<br />
  Still the buffalo lingered,<br />
  Cropping the blue-grey grasses,<br />
  Plunging in the muddy wallows,<br />
  Always near us.<br />
  I could almost touch a shaggy flank.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Two years ago to-day, in Piccadilly&mdash;<br />
  That tea-shop place the day before we sailed<br />
  He said, "It may be wild enough out there,<br />
  But I shall keep you safe&mdash;<br />
  Oh, I shall keep you safe!"<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  We loitered through that first bright autumn<br />
  And on the edge of winter had no meat.<br />
  Who wants meat, here, must follow it&mdash;and kill.<br />
  So, like a band of pilgrims, we set out&mdash;<br />
  Unguarded women are not left behind&mdash;<br />
  Walking beside our husbands all the way.<br />
  Far out of sight, the Indians<br />
  Search for the roaming herds.<br />
  They are on splendid ponies.<br />
  We settlers are the country's parasites.<br />
  When Mary Scott, the factor's wife, and I,<br />
  With two young squaws, were left a day in camp<br />
  We learned an incantation.<br />
  Another day when we were on the trail<br />
  My wedding ring was taken from my hand<br />
  Just as a warning,<br />
  A little necessary bright horse-play,<br />
  To show us who was master.<br />
  Five days of march and then the broad plateau&mdash;<br />
  White plains, brown beasts,<br />
  Red, flying figures of the Indian guides,<br />
  Bonfires at night and sleep in soft skin bags,<br />
  Warm blood of slaughter&mdash;<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  But&mdash;<br />
  It takes a letter sixty days to go,<br />
  Even at this season, when there is no snow.<br />
  Autumn has fallen on London.<br />
  I can see you in the sweet old room.<br />
  Please do not change a thing until I come!<br />
  Fires will be lit, your velvet curtains drawn,<br />
  And when you read my letter, dearest one,<br />
  Pray that some great day I may have a son<br />
  To mingle past with present.<br />
  For now each treacherous hour seems all of life;<br />
  I am as much a hunter as a wife,<br />
  To whom the summer is a breathing space,<br />
  Who waits for autumn<br />
  And trots beside her husband, through the grass<br />
  That shudders in the late November wind,<br />
  Or lies like frozen foam beneath our feet,<br />
  Looking for buffalo meat!<br />
</p>

  RETURN OF THE TRAPPERS
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Against the rolling snowdrifts,<br />
  Misted by the frost-fog,<br />
  Dwarfish, pigmy figures,<br />
  See them come!<br />
  Open the gates of the great stockade,<br />
  Welcome them home.<br />
  There's my Red-Scarf!<br />
  I can almost hear him snarling,<br />
  "Marche!  Marche!"<br />
  Down at old Fort Garry,<br />
  I have heard them say<br />
  That they take the women,<br />
  Who dog-trot behind them<br />
  All the way.<br />
  Not out here!  Not out here!<br />
  With the glass at minus forty<br />
  Half the year!<br />
  There's the first big husky&mdash;<br />
  Think you hear his bell?<br />
  That is Henri leading;<br />
  Yes, among a thousand halfbreeds,<br />
  I would know his yell!<br />
  What you bet the sleds hold?<br />
  There's a slide!<br />
  Why that drift the other day<br />
  Stretched a half mile wide.<br />
  What you bet the sleds hold?<br />
  Fire the gun!<br />
  Here the women come, pell mell.<br />
  They've got ears, those Indian women,<br />
  Not much need to fire the gun!<br />
  Now we're in for days of steeping,<br />
  Matching, drying, sorting&mdash;rum.<br />
  Hear the whips crack!<br />
  Hi!  Hi!<br />
  See, that's Henri!<br />
  Three, four, five&mdash;<br />
  Not one train lost.<br />
  Here they come!<br />

  AN OLD LADY<br />
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  Madame de Courament excels at Bridge.<br />
  Hers is a clever hand,<br />
  Coloured with age and wrinkled;<br />
  But beautiful and tapering too,<br />
  Quite in accord with this old, stately room,<br />
  With crystal chandeliers,<br />
  And flowers and the warm tapestry of books.<br />
  Silent the cards fall.<br />
  Down the long avenue a dog howls at the moon,<br />
  A far, frost-sharpened sound.<br />
  The wind swirls up a little storm of snow<br />
  That blows against the casement.<br />
  A skilled opponent, Madame makes few mistakes<br />
  Like that a moment since,<br />
  When suddenly the dog howled&mdash;and we lost a trick.<br />
  She has a flashing wit,<br />
  Dinners at Rideau Hall are incomplete without her.<br />
  As someone said the other day,<br />
  "These elderly, elaborate folk<br />
  Are like a passing pageantry,<br />
  Gorgeous and of another day."<br />
  Silent the cards fall.<br />
  Again the far-off dog howls at the moon.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  An hour later, "Chateau Laurier" she told the chauffeur.<br />
  And, alert and gay,<br />
  Wrapped in her sables,<br />
  She was motoring me the long white way to town<br />
  And gossiping of little this and that.<br />
  But just as we were nearing city lights<br />
  She said, "I saw you noticed that dog's bark.<br />
  It sounded almost like a wolf's;<br />
  It took me back to the Red River days.<br />
  Oh, it was fifty years ago, my dear;<br />
  I was as young as you ... It seems like yesterday.<br />
  Hardships!  I loved it all!<br />
  Even the wolves, baying far out of sight,<br />
  Failed to disturb our rest<br />
  When we were safe at home.<br />
  The Indians were quite friendly&mdash;<br />
  And the eternal glamour of the snow!<br />
  And yet to-night, just when I heard that sound,<br />
  Sharpened by frost,<br />
  I felt an old pain strike me,<br />
  The knife-like thrust, before a child is born.<br />
  I was alone that night.<br />
  My husband had been called to Edmonton,<br />
  My Indian maid had let her family in<br />
  Looking for whiskey.<br />
  I dared not call to her.<br />
  For hours the Indians danced and sang and yelled.<br />
  I watched them from my icy-cold bedroom<br />
  Through great cracks in the floor.<br />
  Before they slept they sat crouched by the fire,<br />
  As I crouched up above in fright and pain.<br />
  And all night long I heard the wolves;<br />

  Nothing behind but the branding irons,<br />

  As they sailed in their rickety death-traps;<br />
  They laughed as they rode,<br />

  And suddenly, like a blue cup held high,<br />
  The lake Mazinawa ...<br />
  All silence, silence, silence&mdash;<br />
  Dark colours filling the blue cup.<br />
  And, like a purple stain against the sunset,<br />
  The great rock of Mazinawa,<br />
  Sacred to Indian tribes how long ago!<br />
  A thousand years ago?<br />
  Why should one care to know!<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  It looms up larger than I dreamed;<br />
  Roadways of rock<br />
  And canyons full of light;<br />
  Niched balconies for pines bent all one way;<br />
  Small birds in flight,<br />
  Dashing against the dark<br />
  Of that vast rocky flank,<br />
  Whose sides of iron seams,<br />
  Laid under golden lichen,<br />
  Have been a place of dreams<br />
  And of brute sacrifice.<br />
  What if it has a power to draw us near<br />
  As in the days of fear?<br />
  When from the rocklands of the Georgian Bay<br />
  Or through the bush roads whence we came to-day,<br />
  But then on foot, soft-padding all the way,<br />
  Or in the war canoes<br />
  They crowded to this small blue lake of theirs<br />
  And an old shrine ...<br />
  What are we floating towards<br />
  In this small, low canoe?<br />
  A naked, ceremonial singing past<br />
  Seems to reach out and whisper.<br />

  Once in the twilight aisles of Amiens<br />
  I thought I knew what shadows were,<br />
  Creeping in golden dust and greying dust,<br />

  Liquid in spacing, that those arches span.<br />

  But just last night, before the moon was up,<br />
  Our little boat stole close against these crags<br />
  That out-rear arches and reject the dark.<br />
  Yet gradually the purple of the rock<br />
  Melted before it; and again they came<br />
  Creeping in golden dust, and greying dust,<br />
  And crowding down those giant flights of stair<br />
  That open slowly as eternity,<br />
  To hold the feet of shadows, lost in night.<br />

  Then I remembered Götterdammerüng&mdash;<br />
  How before doom falls on the gorgeous host,<br />
  Slowly there drifts across the empty stage<br />
  A smoke-cloud, lonely as a passing soul.<br />
  In very truth the gods return to you&mdash;<br />
  Great rock that blazes colour in the sun&mdash;<br />
  And, as in the Valhalla of old song,<br />
  Parade before our eyes the whole day long<br />
  And make a glorious end,<br />
  As with you they are folded in a sleep.<br />
  No cloud foretells their doom, but wings of birds<br />
  A moment sweep your side&mdash;then fall away.<br />

  Stony fields and lonely roads,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meagre hamlets, very lean,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lying all between.<br />

<p class="poem">
  Each few miles a graveyard,<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very dark and solemn.<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those who in their hour<br />

  On the Ægean, so the stories run,<br />
  Greek youths, with many a saffron-coloured sail,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Again, on the bright shores of this small lake,<br />
  Purple of hills and pink of northern rocks.<br />

<p class="poem">
  With fish and basketwork she plied her trade,<br />

<p class="poem">
  Ages ago, perhaps, the trees were elfin<br />
  And tall grass towered to the skies,<br />
  Until, to all those narrow, screen-like eyes,<br />

  Peopled with glittering prey;<br />
  Dense borderland to where the black pools lay<br />
  Whose captives twist and turn.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Burrowing, boa-like, harlequin snakes,<br />
  Your day was brilliant and flashing enough!<br />
  Snakes casting skins in continuous slough,<br />
  Grass snakes and ring snakes, on dragon-flies bent.<br />
  Was there a charmer, with musical pipe,<br />
  Lured you a moment?  Some Indian charm<br />
  Surely touched you with sorcery, gave you alarm,<br />
  Ere the people who meant to build houses like these<br />
  Came and killed you&mdash;<br />

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
